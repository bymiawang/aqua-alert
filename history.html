        History

    <h4>
        Catalina Drought History
    </h4>
    <p>
        The island of Catalina is known for it's beauty, tourist destinations, and scientfic
        research center. But even moreso for it's history of droughts. The state of California
         has a drought history of it's own but it is that of Catalina's history that is quite telling 
         of the political and ecological climate of the island.
         <br>
         <br>
        Worries of the water supply arose as the residential and tourist population of Catalina island 
        grew. Water supplies could no longer keep up with the needs of it's users and 
        with the island without rainfall for most of the year, other measures had to be taken 
        to fulfil the water needs of residents and tourists alike. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The timeline of the inputted measures is explored below.
    </p>



    
<br>
    <h4>1992</h4>
    <p>Desalination plant created to supplement water supply
        holds up to 230,400 gallons for fresh water per day when needed.
        <li>Avalon became the first city on West Coast to have it’s own municipal desolation plant</li>
        <li> Plans for the plant faced backlash from enviornmental groups, as the current desalation process</li> 
        <li>Involved the release of briny chemicals into the sea that could potentially kill marine organisms and disrupt the island ecosystem.</li>
    </p>

    <br>
    <h4>2014</h4>
    <p>Catalina placed under stage 2 water rationing during historic drought.
        <li>The Middle Reservoir, a main water supply was down to nearly 1/4th it’s capacity, </li> 
        <li>Restrictions were placed on residents and penalties enforced if they didn’t reduce their water usage by 25%</li>

    </p>

    <br>
    <h4>2016</h4>
    <p> Second desolation plant constructed
        <li> Even with a production of 150,000 gallons per day, it was not enough to fully pull Catalina Island out 
            of their drought.</li>
        <li>Provided around 40% of Avalon’s drinking water</li>
       
    </p>

    <br>
    <h4>September 2016</h4>
    <p> Catalina Island placed under Stage 3 drought conditions
        <li>Residents had to reduce water usage by 50% </li>
        <li>The Middle Reservoir water levels dropped to nearly 1/10th it’s capacity </li>
        <li> Luckily  thsi drought season was followed by a record breaking 24-hour rainfall period 
            that filled reservoir and wells to pre-drought levels </li>
    </p>

    <br>
    <h4>2019</h4>
    <p> A wet winter led to the recovery of low water levels from the 2016 drought
        <li>Occasional fluctuating of drought levels</li>
    </p>

    <br>
    <h4>2023 - Present</h4>
    <p> Catalina Island placed under Stage 1 drought conditions and rationing
    </p>
